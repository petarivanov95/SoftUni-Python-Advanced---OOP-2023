# The sorting section is the if adding_condition: block that generates the output 
# if any products have been added to the inventory. The sorted_data variable sorts
# the inventory dictionary in descending order by the length of the inventory 
# list, and then by the meal type. The key parameter in the sorted function is 
# a lambda function that takes a key-value pair from the inventory dictionary and
# returns a tuple that is used for sorting. The tuple contains two elements: 
# the negative length of the inventory list (to sort in descending order), 
# and the meal type. This ensures that the inventory is sorted first by the length
# of the inventory list (with the longest list first), and then by the meal type
# (alphabetically).
